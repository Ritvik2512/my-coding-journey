# My Coding Journey

Welcome to the mess.  
This repo is where I dump all the code I’ve written (and will keep writing) as I learn programming.  
Mostly C/C++, some random experiments, and probably a lot of stuff that doesn’t make sense yet.

It’s not organized like a textbook, and it’s definitely not perfect — just a place to track my progress and maybe cringe at later.

Feel free to look around. Or don’t. I’m still figuring things out.
